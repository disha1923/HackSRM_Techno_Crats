When people genuinely enjoy their profession and are motivated by their passion, they tend to be more satisfied with their work and psychologically healthy. Mostly obtained when the person views their activity as a part of the person's identity, then the motivation to continue the specific hobby is even stronger. We will be developing an application where background knowledge, interests and passions are considered to suggest a path that suits one's interests.  Job offers, internships, events and other opportunities are suggested for the chosen passion which gives the user a clear view and also gives an opportunity to take up the particular job, degree/course or obtain information and monetize the passion through the application.
